# What is time tracking?
Time Tracking is a mobile app that monitors the time it takes for work orders to be completed by manufacturing plant operators. As soon as a work order is generated, operators can select it and start timing how long it takes for a task to be completed in a work order.

# What are the benefits?
By knowing how long each task takes in a work order, manufactures get better insights into their processes. They can give accurate estimated timed deliveries, find anomalies in their workflow processes and charge the right price for their services.
